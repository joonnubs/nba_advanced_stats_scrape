# nba_advanced_stats_scrape

The following can be used to scrape the advanced stats that nba.com does not direectly provide in a easily consumable manner such as scoring, usage, defense, etc. As the data has only been tracked since the 2000's (data recorded in the 90s maybe unreliable), there is a limited amount of data available. However, the game has evolved to the extent that eras maybe treated in their own categories and the limited data can still prove to be insightful despite these limitations. 

Additional projects that combine data provided by nba.com and nba reference will be leveraged for EDAs in the future.
